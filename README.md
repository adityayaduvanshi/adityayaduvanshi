Hi, I'm [Aditya Yaduvanshi](https://www.instagram.com/fixslayrxx/) and I am web developer and web desginer.My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

Here's a list of things I currently keep myself busy with:

- 👩🏻‍💻 Working as a software engineer over at **[Rounded](https://rounded.io)**
- ☀️ Maintaining **[Letra](https://github.com/jayehernandez/letra-extension)**, an open-source project I created (feel free to contribute, this is beginner friendly!)
- ✍️ Writing tech blog posts over at **[dev.to](https://dev.to/jayehernandez)**.
- 🛠 Getting myself into JAMStack. Trying out [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) in my spare time.
